            Like many other forms of artwork, a painting uses the following main
            elements to convey the painter's intent and theme: color, texture,
            shapes, lines, and tone. A painting can be in a variety of forms
            based on the painter's preference or choice of materials.

        <h2>What Our Customers Say</h2>
        <p>
          I highly recommend Painting Hub for all your painting needs! They
          painted our entire home images in under three days and were by far the
          easiest and fastest painters to work with in Charlottesville. Everyone
          was professional and thorough throughout the entire process.
